# ScaleReach's Speech Service
Handles speech synthesis and recognition within ScaleReach with multilanguage support

- Recognition: Uses websockets to streams raw audio data in opus codecs in mpeg containers for live transcription
- Synthesis: Uses simple HTTP requests to obtain streamable audio data in aac codecs
